# SortingAlg
 Visualized Bubble-Sort Algorithm

My goal is to visualize multiple sorting algoritms, much like <a href=https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/>Timo Bingmann's</a> projects.

Here's what it looks like right now:

I've only implemented bubble-sort at the moment.

This was accomplished using C++ and <a href=https://www.sfml-dev.org/>SFML</a>

Expect poor coding practices, this was just meant for personal use.
